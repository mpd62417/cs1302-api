## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to describe
> exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected in a meaningful way.

> Also, include the GitHub https URL to your repository.

    This app allows users to enter cities in the US and returns a list of buttons of 45 different birds spotted in that area.
    All of those buttons can be clicked on to redirect the user to a Wikipedia article about that bird. One API used was the
    Zippopotam.us API, which was used to convert city and state names into a set of coordinates. Those coordinates were then
    used with the eBird API to return a list of bird spotted within fifty kilometers of those coordinates. Finally, all of
    bird names were used as title names with the Wikipedia API to return the specified article of that bird.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

    I learned how to retrieve nested fields from APIs, and how to better read the public documentation
    for online APIs and understand how to use them from the examples shown.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

    I would have done more research on what APIs used limits and subscription models,
    so that I didn't have to change plans on what the app would do later on. I didn't
    look into the image APIs until later in the project, and then realized I would make too
    many calls to the API. If I had been more organized from the start, that wouldn't
    have happened.
